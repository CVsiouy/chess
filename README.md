## How To Start

## Challenges and Solutions

Challenges that I have faced and how i tackled them:

1. Coding of tricky moves like en passant, capturing, casteling 
   - Solution: Solved with strategical thinking and hit & trail to write proper code for the above moves

2. Blocking of moves during checkmate
   - Solution: Solved by assigning king with the highest value possible and blocking pieces if king is in checkmate 

3. Dragging & release of pieces in different positions
   - Solution: Using arrays and marking filled positions to have only valid moves

4. User Experience
   - Solution: Improved the user experience through UI/UX best practices.

## Roadmap

- Assign pieces to position in GUI and make straight moves, diagonal moves and knight moves
- Introduce rest of the moves like castling, en passent and capturing
- Implement better UI for User Experience
- Optimize performance and add more features based on user feedback
